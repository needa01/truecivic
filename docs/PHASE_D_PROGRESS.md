## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Task D1: Vote Records Adapter ‚úÖ (Commit f6940d9)

**Purpose**: Fetch individual MP voting records to answer "How did MP X vote on Bill Y?"

**Files Created**:
1. **src/db/repositories/vote_repository.py** (420 lines)
   - `VoteRepository`: Batch upsert for votes table
   - `VoteRecordRepository`: Batch upsert for vote_records table
   - Methods: `get_by_id`, `get_by_vote_id`, `get_by_bill`, `get_by_session`
   - Voting pattern analytics: `get_politician_voting_pattern()`
   - PostgreSQL ON CONFLICT upsert for performance

2. **src/prefect_flows/vote_with_records_flow.py** (360 lines)
   - `fetch_votes_with_records_flow`: Main orchestration
   - `fetch_latest_votes_hourly_flow`: Hourly scheduled flow
   - Tasks: `fetch_votes_batch`, `fetch_vote_records`, `store_votes_batch`, `store_vote_records_batch`
   - Batch processing with concurrent execution
   - Rate limit handling (first 10 votes for records, then first 20 for hourly)

**Integration**:
- Uses `OpenParliamentVotesAdapter.fetch_vote_by_id()` (already has MP records in `ballots` field)
- Uses `VoteModel` and `VoteRecordModel` (schema already migrated)
- Ready for Prefect deployment with hourly schedule

**Impact**:
- Enables "MP voting history" feature
- RSS feed: `/feeds/mp/{id}/votes.xml` can show actual votes
- Graph API: Can show MP-bill-vote relationships
- MP activity feeds complete

### Task D2: Committee Meetings Adapter ‚úÖ (Commit c145856)

**Purpose**: Fetch committee meetings and witness information for transparency

**Files Created**:
1. **src/adapters/openparliament_committees.py** (395 lines)
   - `OpenParliamentCommitteeAdapter` class
   - Methods: `fetch_committees`, `fetch_committee_meetings`, `fetch_meeting_details`
   - Extracts witnesses (name, organization, title)
   - Extracts documents (title, url, doctype)
   - Transforms to standardized format

2. **src/db/repositories/committee_repository.py** (233 lines)
   - `CommitteeRepository`: CRUD + batch upsert for committees table
   - Methods: `get_by_id`, `get_by_code`, `get_all`, `search_by_name`
   - Filter by jurisdiction and chamber (Commons/Senate)
   - PostgreSQL ON CONFLICT upsert

3. **src/prefect_flows/committee_flow.py** (330 lines)
   - `fetch_all_committees_flow`: Fetch all committees
   - `fetch_committee_meetings_flow`: Fetch meetings for multiple committees
   - `fetch_all_committees_daily_flow`: Daily scheduled (runs at 4 AM)
   - `fetch_top_committees_meetings_daily_flow`: Top 10 committees daily
   - Tracks major committees: HUMA, FINA, JUST, ENVI, HESA, NDDN, ETHI, PROC, TRAN, AGRI

**Integration**:
- Uses `CommitteeModel` (schema already migrated)
- Ready for Prefect deployment with daily schedule
- **Note**: `store_meetings_task` is placeholder (no `CommitteeMeetingModel` yet)

**TODO**:
- Create `CommitteeMeetingModel` + Alembic migration
- Create `CommitteeMeetingRepository`
- Update `store_meetings_task` to persist meetings

**Impact**:
- Enables "Committee Activity" RSS feeds
- Graph API: Can show bill-committee relationships
- Frontend: Committee pages with meeting schedules
